# Minesweeper clone

Made in python by Johan just for fun when I should be studying...

## How to play

```
# without command line arguments gets you a grid with dimensions 30x40
python3 main.py

# ...or you can specify row and col dim
python3 main.py <row> <col> # <row> and <col> as positive ints
```

```
# for max fun in the terminal, add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc (don't know what to do on windows)
alias minesweeper='python3 path/to/code/main.py'
```
